# shopping-list

A categorized shopping list to keep track of your stuff!


## Categories

Get you fresh stuff first, then your groceries (middle areas), then your alcohol, then your others (toothpaste, dog food, etc). This matches up with a typical supermarket organization.

Avoid circling back.

Efficiency!
